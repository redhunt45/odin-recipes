# odin-recipes

This is a first project. This is four static html pages. The goal of this was to create a main index.html landing page that has links to the three pages using an unordered list. 
Each page has a h1 heading with an image linked below the heading. 
Following the h1 is an h2 with the title of the recipe. 
Following this is an unordered list for the ingredients and then an ordered list for the steps to make the recipe.
